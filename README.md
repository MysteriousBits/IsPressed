Utilty/Necessity:
Ispressed might be helpul for screen recording, live streaming, making tutorials, showing hotkeys to the viewers without telling everytime.
Besides using it during recording will make it easier while editing the video as not have to add shortcut keys to that. Much useful for content 
creators and artists and other complex software users.

Last Words:
Its a vary simple script but as I'm newbie[even couldnt add any efficient comments yet and also maybe a bit messy with the code :)]
 and this is the first version of it, it may have bugs.
So apologize me and inform me about bugs or any new feauture is needed.
